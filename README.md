`npm install`

Install passport-local-mongoose from github because we need features not yet
part of the official release

`npm install https://github.com/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose.git`

NB: Need to re-add `    "passport-local-mongoose": "~0.2.5",` to package.json 
whenever the above is addressed.
